# Calculations
## Velocity Ratio

$$ \frac{N_{i}}{N_{o}} = \frac{d_{o}}{d_{i}} = \text{Speed ratio} $$

Standard pulley diameters

> 40, 45, 50, 56, 63, 71, 80, 90, 100, 112, 125, 140, 160, 180, 200, 224, 250, 280, 315, 355, 400, 450, 500, 560, 630, 710, 800, 900, 1000, 1120, 1250, 1400,1600, 1800, 2000

## Design Power

$$ \text{Design power} = \frac{\text{Rated power} * \text{Load correction factor}}{\text{Contact factor} * \text{Smaller pulley diameter factor}}, $$

where the rated power is a project parameter and the correction factors may be determined by the following equations and attached tables.

$$ \text{Contact factor} = 180° - \frac{D-d}{C} * 60° $$

After finding the arc of contact, it must be changed to the nearest standardized value, as shown in Table 2.

The number of plies may be chosen by using reference tables, e.g. Shigley's or PSG Machine Design Handbook's.

## Belt and Pulley Width

$$ b = \frac{\text{Design power}}{\text{No. of plies} * \text{Load rating at operating speed}} mm $$

The value calculated with the formula above must be substituted by the nearest standardized value, which can be consulted in catalogues.

Additional width in the pulley is needed in order to accomodate properly the belt. As we are working with relatively low torques, an additional width of 15 mm is enough.

## Belt Length

For an open flat belt drive, it is given by:

$$ L = 2*C + \frac{\pi}{2} * (d_{0} + d_{i}) + \frac{(d_{0} - d_{i})^{2}}{4} * C $$
